        h2 Using hotkeys
        section
            p.
                All actions of the designer can be accessed via hotkeys. Learning these hotkeys will
                                    allow you to work quicker and concentrate more on your design and less on the tool.
            p.
                The hotkeys for the three primitives above are:

            ul
                li C - Circle
                li R - Rectangle
                li L - Line

            p.
                All tools behave the same, no matter if you activated them using a hotkey or the toolbar.
                In this designer we've hidden the toolbar. Try drawing with those primitives
                again.
