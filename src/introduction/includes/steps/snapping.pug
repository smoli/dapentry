                One important feature is snapping. You can snap to points of other objects when
                creating and transforming objects.

            p.
                The canvas you're drawing on has snap points as well. This allows you to create drawings that
                always fit into the canvas and change when the canvas size changes.

            p.
                Try drawing again. You'll see snap points appear for the canvas, circle and every object that
                you have drawn. You can also manipulate the objects.

            p.
                It's important to understand that using snap points does not mean the objects
                are connected. For example, if you draw a line starting from the right snap point of
                the circle, that line will not move, when you move the circle.
